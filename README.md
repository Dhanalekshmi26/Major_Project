E-Waste Analysis and Predicting Recycling Method
📌 Overview
This project is a web-based application that helps users identify electronic waste (e-waste) and find the best recycling methods for it. By uploading an image of an electronic device or component, the system can determine:

What kind of electronic device it is.

Whether it is e-waste or not.

How it can be recycled properly.

It uses two artificial intelligence (AI) models to analyze images and provide results based on a pre-defined recycling knowledge base.

🔹 Key Features
✅ Easy Image Upload – Users can upload a picture of an electronic item.
✅ Device Detection – AI predicts what device or component is in the image.
✅ E-Waste Classification – If the device is unknown, another AI model checks if it is e-waste.
✅ Recycling Suggestions – The system provides proper recycling methods based on the detected item.
✅ User-Friendly Web Interface – No need for coding skills, just upload an image and get results!

📍 How It Works – Step by Step
Step 1: Upload an Image
The user uploads an image of an electronic device (e.g., mobile phone, battery, PCB, etc.) using the website.

Step 2: Image Preprocessing
The system prepares the image before analyzing it:
🔹 The image is resized to 224x224 pixels to match the AI model’s requirements.
🔹 It is converted into numerical values so that the AI can understand it.

Step 3: Device Detection (First AI Model)
The system first tries to recognize the electronic device in the image using a pre-trained AI model (MobileNetV2).

If the system finds a match with high confidence, it will label the device and move to the next step.

If it does not find a match, the system proceeds to Step 4.

Step 4: E-Waste Classification (Second AI Model)
If the first model fails to detect the device, another AI model is used to check:

Is the item e-waste?

Or is it a non-electronic item?

If the system classifies it as e-waste, it moves to the next step to find recycling information.

Step 5: Recycling Recommendations
Once the system knows what the device is, it checks a predefined database (recycling_info.json) to provide information on:

How to recycle the device properly.

Which parts (internal components) need special recycling.

Suggested recycling methods (e.g., mechanical separation, pyro-metallurgical recovery, hydrometallurgical processing).

Step 6: Displaying the Results
The system generates a response showing:

The detected device name (if found).

Whether it is e-waste or non-e-waste.

Recycling methods if available.
